# Berry documentation

This repository contains the short and full versions of [Berry](https://github.com/berry-lang/berry) documentation.

It is currently under high rework.

# berry_doc

Note: Chinese version of the documentation is outdated and no longer maintained. They are kept under `archive/` for reference.

## English

The Berry Short Manual is kept in XeLaTex format to make it concise and nice looking (and Skiars did most ot the heavy-lifting). The full documentation is migrated on-line to be edited directly as reStructuredText (RST).
